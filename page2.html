 This page is displayed in an iframe
</h2>

<p>
  The &lt;iframe&gt; element in HTML, short for inline frame, is used to embed another HTML page within the current page. This allows the display of content like videos, interactive maps, or even entire websites seamlessly within a section of the webpage. The attributes of the &lt;iframe&gt; tag, such as `src`, define the URL of the page to embed, and dimensions like `width` and `height` allow customization of the visible area. Although highly versatile, the misuse of &lt;iframe&gt; can pose security risks, like clickjacking. Thus, incorporating the &lt;iframe&gt; element thoughtfully enhances the user experience without compromising web security.
